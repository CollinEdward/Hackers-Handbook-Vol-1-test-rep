## What is localhost

Localhost is a hostname in computer networking that relates to the present device used to access it. It is used to connect to the host's network services via the loopback network interface. By using the loopback interface, you can avoid using any local network interface hardware.

## What is your localhost?

Localhost's IP address is 127.0.0.1, which refers to your own "server".
