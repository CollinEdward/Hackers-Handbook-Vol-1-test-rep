**Welcome to *Hackers Handbook* Vol. 1!**

**This is all strictly for Educational Purposes. We are not responsable for any actions you make which can lead to trouble, it is highly illegal to use hacking for malicious purposes on unauthorized systems and systems which you haven't gotten permission to test on**



This is the `docs` and `handbook` for learning or getting the basics updated in cyber security and information gathering. It contains:

* Operating systems ‚úÖ
* Virtual machines -> setting one up, and the different Operating systems ‚úÖ
* Simple Linux/GNU commands ‚úÖ
* Nmap -> running scnas against servers ‚úÖ
* Phishing -> Social Engineering Tool Kit ‚úÖ
* Metasploit framework attacking and usage ‚úÖ

## What is hacking?

This is a question most begginers might not ask, but it is important to understand that it is not what you see in most movies. It is not the 3D objects spinning on computers, or terminal emulators spitting out a masive amount of information (most of the time) that is all in all useless. 

It is all completely different. Looking at the show Mr. robot it's a good comparison to what `real` hacking could look like. But as in Mr. robot where everything seems easy, it is not always like that in the real world, you will incounter many errors and doing the same things again and again, only changingn one veriable at a time. "Trial and Error".

## How do you get startedü§∑

You can get started a lot of ways, but the hardest bit it to understand what to search for, and how to use the google search engine to find the problem solutions or "tutorials" that you are looking for. It is always hard to find something, that you didn't know you were looking for.

First you have to understand what your best learning metode is. 
Is it visual learning, reading, lectures with a shifting between reading and visual learning?
There's a lot of other differnet learning methods, but the most common one that most people learn form is visual learning, when it comes to something new with a lot of new words. The reason for that is many people don't want to search and understand every single new word by looking it up in a dictionary or somewhere else, when they have to understand it. This means that pictures or video instructions can be great.

One of the other types of learning is reading.. you will almost always come to a part in learning where there won't be a video lecture or tutorial on how to do the thing in question. Which is where reading and handbooks come in handy. The same as a video or picture you can go back and read the same thing multiple times until you understand it. 
One of the differences between a video and written text is that you can highligt or reffer to something much faster in your notes by copying and pasting and then highlighting the text and summerising it.

## What is penetration testing‚ùî

A penetration test, also known as a pen test or ethical hacking, is an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system undertaken to examine the system's security. This is not the same as a vulnerability assessment. The test is run to discover flaws (also known as vulnerabilities), such as the possibility of unauthorized parties gaining access to the system's features and data, as well as strengths that allow a thorough risk assessment to be completed.
