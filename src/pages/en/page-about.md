# Who am I ( The Hackers Handbook Vol. 1 Writer? 

Hello, my name is not relevent in this matter but. I've been in front of a computer since I was a child and have always had a penchant for producing things since I'm creative and can think outside the box when necessary. Python3/3.10 -> GUI and CLI apps are my specialties. I began programming when I was nine, creating rudimentary HTML webpages, but I didn't take it seriously until I was twelve. Now, I focus on producing software with the computer programming language Python3, and my aims are simply to improve my programming language skills and transform problem-solving into code. In addition, I am familiar with GNU/Linux and the bash terminal; I use GNU/Linux as my operating system. Furthermore I know my ways around cyber security and networking.
