## What is hardware?
Hardware are the physical components of your computer, being the [GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit), [CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit), [Motherboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard) and so on. 


## GPU

An electronic circuit known as a graphics processing unit (GPU) is specialized and created to manipulate and change memory in order to speed up the production of images in a frame buffer that are intended to be output to a display device. GPUs are found in embedded devices, mobile phones, PCs, workstations, and game consoles.

## CPU

A central processing unit (CPU), often known as a central processor, main processor, or simply processor, is the electrical circuitry that processes computer program instructions.

## Motherboard

A motherboard is the primary printed circuit board (PCB) of general-purpose computers and other extensible systems. It is also known as a mainboard, main circuit board, mb, mboard, backplane board, base board, system board, logic board (only in Apple computers), or mobo. It stores and communicates with many of the system's critical electrical components, including as the central processor unit (CPU) and memory, and offers ports for various peripherals.
